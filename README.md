`ansible-galaxy-outdated` shows currently installed [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) collections
with updated version in [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).

This is a workaround until `ansible-galaxy` themself have such a function.
See GitHub issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75632>.
